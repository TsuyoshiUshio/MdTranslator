# MdTranslator

Translate markdown document on your repository.

# Motivation

When I run the international event in Japan, we made a lot of effort to translate the contents into Japanese. 
I'd like to automate this effort by the power of the Durable Functions. 

# Outcome 

* Create a new branch 
* Translate all `.md` document into the target language
